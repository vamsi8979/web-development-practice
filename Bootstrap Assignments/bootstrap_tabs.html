                    Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine,
                    that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of
                    modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine, programmed using a principle
                    openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom.
