                      <b>Chess</b> is a board game between two players. 
                      It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to 
                      distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the 
                    second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar but much older 
                    game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by 
                    millions of people worldwide.

                    <b>Carroms</b> Carrom is a tabletop game of Indian origin 
                    in which players flick discs, attempting to knock them to the corners of the board.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The game is very popular in the Indian subcontinent, and is known by various names 
                    in different languages. In South Asia, many clubs and caf√©s hold regular tournaments. 
                    Carrom is very commonly played by families, including children, and at social functions. 
                    Different standards and rules exist in different areas. It became very popular in the 
                    United Kingdom and the Commonwealth during the early 20th century.

                      <b>Table Tennis</b> also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, 
                      is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, 
                      also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table 
                      using small solid rackets. It takes place on a hard table divided by a net.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: Players 
                    must allow a ball played toward them to bounce once on their side of the table 
                    and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side. A point is scored 
                    when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands 
                    quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's 
                    options, giving the hitter a great advantage.

                  <p>
                    Two cue balls (one white and one yellow) and a red object ball are used. Each player or team uses a different 
                    cue ball. It is played on a billiards table with the same dimensions as one used for snooker and points are 
                    scored for cannons and pocketing the balls.
