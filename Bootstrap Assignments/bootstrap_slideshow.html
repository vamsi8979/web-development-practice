                      <b>Cricket</b> is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players 
                      on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at 
                      each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps

                  <p>
                    The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with
                    the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries
                    to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to 
                    either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").

                    <b>Tennis</b> is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent
                    (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).

                  <p>
                    Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered
                    with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre
                    the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable 
                    to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
