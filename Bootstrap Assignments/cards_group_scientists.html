            <p class="card-text">
                <b>Alan Mathison Turing</b> was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
               philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
              providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
              which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.

              <b>Charles Babbage</b> was an English polymath.[1] A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and
              mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer
            </p>
            <p>
              Babbage is considered by some to be "father of the computer".
              Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine,
              that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of
              modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine, programmed using a principle
              openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom.

              <b>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie</b> was an American computer scientist.

              <b>Albert Einstein</b>  was a German-born theoretical physicist,
               widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.

            <p>
              Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity,
              but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.
              Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.

            </p>
            <p>
              Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical
              expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams
